# Pathfinding-with-A-Search

Pathfinding	is	a	common	problem	that	artificial	agents	must	solve,	including
mapping	services,	artificial	vehicles, AIs	in	real-time	strategy	games, and	robots	that	
must	navigate	in	the	physical	world.	For	this	assignment	we	will	focus	on	simplified	
pathfinding	problem.	Your	program	will	search	for	the	shortest	path	from	a	starting	
location	to	a	goal	location	on	a	square	grid.	However,	this	grid	will	have	some	
impassable	locations	and	varying	terrain	costs	that	must	be	accounted	for.	The	
agent	is	allowed	to move	in	any	of	the	four	primary	directions	(up,	down,	left,	right)	
but	not	diagonally	or	outside	the	bounds	of	the	map.
